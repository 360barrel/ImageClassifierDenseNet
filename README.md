## Introduction

The **ImageClassifierDenseNet** project aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for image classification. It leverages the DenseNet architecture, known for its efficiency and accuracy in image recognition tasks. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate image classification into your application or a researcher exploring machine learning, this tool can help.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web application is designed for ease of use.
- **Fast Classification**: Thanks to the DenseNet model, you get quick and accurate results.
- **Supports Various Image Formats**: Upload images in formats like JPEG, PNG, and more.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Get instant classification results after uploading an image.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project or modify it for your needs.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates several technologies to provide a robust image classification experience:

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Core technology for image recognition.
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive web design.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes advanced neural networks.
- **DenseNet121**: The specific architecture used for image classification.
- **Flask**: The web framework that powers the application.
- **HTML/CSS**: For front-end development.
- **Python 3**: The programming language used for the backend.
- **PyTorch**: The deep learning library used for model training and inference.
- **Torchvision**: A library for computer vision tasks.

## Installation

To set up the **ImageClassifierDenseNet** application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/360barrel/ImageClassifierDenseNet.git
   cd ImageClassifierDenseNet
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

Your application should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

Using the **ImageClassifierDenseNet** application is straightforward:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Click on the upload button to select an image from your device.
3. After selecting the image, click the "Classify" button.
4. The application will process the image and display the classification result.

## How It Works

The application uses a DenseNet model trained on a large dataset. Here‚Äôs a simplified overview of the process:

1. **Image Upload**: Users upload an image through the web interface.
2. **Preprocessing**: The application preprocesses the image to match the input requirements of the DenseNet model.
3. **Model Inference**: The preprocessed image is passed to the DenseNet model, which outputs a classification.
4. **Result Display**: The application presents the classification result to the user.

### Model Architecture

DenseNet (Densely Connected Convolutional Networks) is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. This architecture helps improve the flow of information and gradients throughout the network, leading to better performance.
